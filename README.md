## The artificially generated microbiome: reproducibility scripts

This is a collection of scripts used for model design, benchmarking and plotting, supporting my MSc thesis: _The artificially generated microbiome: a study on the generation and potential use cases of predicted meta-omics data_. 
The manuscript is available on the [TU Delft education repository](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/search/?collection=education).

### Data availability
The data used for the main experiments was downloaded from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi'omics Database:
- [IBDMDB](https://www.ibdmdb.org/): metagenomics ([genes](https://www.ibdmdb.org/downloads/products/HMP2/MGX/2018-05-04/ecs_relab.tsv.gz), [taxa](https://www.ibdmdb.org/downloads/products/HMP2/MGX/2018-05-04/taxonomic_profiles.biom.gz), and [pathways](https://www.ibdmdb.org/downloads/products/HMP2/MGX/2018-05-04/pathabundances_3.tsv.gz)),
[metatranscriptomics](https://www.ibdmdb.org/downloads/products/HMP2/MTX/2017-12-14/ecs_relab.tsv.gz), [metaproteomics](https://www.ibdmdb.org/downloads/products/HMP2/MPX/2017-03-20/HMP2_proteomics_ecs.tsv.gz) and [metabolomics](https://www.ibdmdb.org/downloads/products/HMP2/MBX/HMP2_metabolomics.biom).

The datasets used for the "reproducibility" experiments were downloaded from two sources:
- Gut microbiome dataset published by Franzosa et al. [1]
- [The Curated Gut Microbiome Metabolome Data Resource](https://github.com/borenstein-lab/microbiome-metabolome-curated-data/tree/main): specifically one ESRD [2] and one colorectal cancer [3] dataset
